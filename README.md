# SAMPLE n-bit Binary Num Generator

This simple C++ program simply creates binary numbers of given bits length. You can create whatever number of binary counting with it. 

## USAGE

```makefile
cd nbit-generator
gcc nbit-generator.cpp -o main
./main -b <number of bits> -n <num of locations> -o <output file>
```



TODOs
-----

1. Add functionality to generate only n number of binary numbers not all the combinations
1. Make it faster if possible
